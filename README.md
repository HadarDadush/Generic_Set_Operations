# GenericSetOperations

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of generic set operations in Java, utilizing generics to create a flexible and reusable `GenericSet` class. 
The program supports basic set operations such as insertion, deletion, union, intersection, and subset checking. 
Additionally, it introduces the `Person` class with comparison capabilities, using generics for set manipulation.

## Features
- Implements a generic set with operations like insert, delete, union, and intersection.
- Demonstrates the use of the `Comparable` interface with the `Person` class for custom comparisons.
- Allows for creating sets of any object type that extends `Comparable`.
- Supports checking if one set is a subset of another.
- Includes exception handling for user inputs during set operations.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Generics
- Comparable Interface
